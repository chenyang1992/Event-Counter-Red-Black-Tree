# Event-Counter-Red-Black-Tree
This program supports redirected input from a file "file-name" which contains the initial sorted list. The command line for this mode is as follows:
$java bbst file-name
I I nput format
n
ID 1 count 1
ID 2 count 2
...
ID n count n

Assume that ID i < ID i+1 where ID i and count i are positive integers 
and the total count fits in 4-byte integer limits.
